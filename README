# chisel

This package contains Clojure wrapper code to do LDA topic modeling
via the MALLET Java API.  For example, we may wish to run LDA directly
against text records in a database without touching the local
filesystem, programmatically extract the learned topics, and write
these to a different database.  The goal of this wrapper code is to
make these kind of tasks easier.

## Usage

(def corpus {"Doc1" "Foo bar baz cattle snow machine",
             "Doc2" "Snoopy snoopy snoopy snoopy", ...})
(def instances (chisel.instances/get-instance-list corpus))
(def T 50)
(def numsamp 500)
(def topicmodel (chisel.lda/run-lda instances :T T :numsamp numsamp))
(chisel.lda/write-topic-word topicmodel "mycorpus.topics")
