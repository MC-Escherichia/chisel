# chisel

This code provides a Clojure wrapper to do Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA) [1] topic modeling via the MALLET [2] Java API.  For example, we
may wish to run LDA directly against text records in a database
without touching the local filesystem, programmatically extract the
learned topics, and write these to a different database.  The goal of
this wrapper code is to make these kind of tasks easier.

## Usage

This wrapper requires you to have already built and installed the
MALLET jar to your local maven repo (see the above link [2]).

You should then be able to install the wrapper with 'lein install' and
use the chisel namespaces in your own code.  For example:

(ns my-example
 (:use (chisel instances lda)))

 (let [docs {"doc1" "cat cat bat bat"
             "doc2" "cat cat bat bat dog dog"
             "doc3" "dog dog dog"}
       inst (chisel.instances/get-instance-list docs)
       tm (chisel.lda/run-lda inst :T 2 :numiter 50 :topwords 3 :alpha 0.5)]
  (chisel.lda/write-topics tm "example.topics" :topwords 3))
